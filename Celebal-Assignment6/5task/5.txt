Task: Configure Taints and Tolerants.

Taints and tolerations are used to control which pods can be scheduled on which nodes in your AKS (or any Kubernetes) cluster.

| Concept        | Purpose                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Taint      | Applied to a node. It repels all pods that donâ€™t explicitly tolerate it. |
| Toleration | Applied to a pod. It allows the pod to be scheduled onto tainted nodes.  |

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Add a Taint to a Node
Get your node names:kubectl get nodes

Taint a node:kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:NoSchedule

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create a Pod with a Toleration
Create a file toleration-pod.yaml:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: toleration-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
  tolerations:
  - key: "special"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "nginx"
    effect: "NoSchedule"

Apply it:kubectl apply -f toleration-pod.yaml

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Confirm It Works
Check where your pod is scheduled:kubectl get pods -o wide

âœ… If everything is correct, the pod should be running on the tainted node.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Test What Happens Without Toleration
Try deploying the same pod without the toleration block. It will stay in Pending state and wonâ€™t schedule on the tainted node.
